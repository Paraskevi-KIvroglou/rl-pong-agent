# rl-pong-agent
This project is part of a Reinforcement Learning course I took during my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at IU. Here, you will find the code and files for a reinforcement learning agent playing pong atari.

This project is self-funded. I was not able to complete the training due to the cost of computing resources. If anyone has further suggestions or  further feedback, please send me an email

If you have a problem installing the  OpenCV library in a Jupyter Notebook, try: !pip install opencv-python-headless
