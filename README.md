# Deep Q-Learning Agent for Atari Pong 🏓
A deep reinforcement learning implementation that masters the classic Atari game Pong using PyTorch and Deep Q-Learning.
🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning Neural Network (DQN) that learns to play Atari's Pong from scratch. The agent learns by interacting with the game environment, developing strategies to defeat the built-in AI opponent.
🚀 Features

Deep Q-Learning implementation using PyTorch
Frame preprocessing for efficient learning
Experience replay buffer for improved training stability
Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
Performance metrics tracking and visualization
Trained model checkpoints

🛠️ Prerequisites

-Python 3.8+

-PyTorch

-OpenAI Gym[atari]

-NumPy

-Matplotlib

This project is part of a Reinforcement Learning course I took during my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at IU. Here, you will find the code and files for a reinforcement learning agent playing pong atari.

This project is self-funded. I was not able to complete the training due to the cost of computing resources. If anyone has further suggestions or  further feedback, please send me an email

If you have a problem installing the  OpenCV library in a Jupyter Notebook, try: !pip install opencv-python-headless
